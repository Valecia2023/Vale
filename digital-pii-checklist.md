PII, also known as “personally identifiable Information,” is data potentially linked or linkable to individuals. The Digital PII Checklist identifies some common types of potential PII that may be collected, maintained, shared, or used in the mobile and digital environment. Agencies may use it as a baseline to ensure they have identified all data that may constitute PII prior to data release. 
 
For the checklist as well as additional information, see the CIO Council's [full report on Standardized Digital Privacy Controls](https://cio.gov/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2012/12/Standardized_Digital_Privacy_Controls.pdf).
